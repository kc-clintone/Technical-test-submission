# Q4: Version Control & Collaboration

- My common Git command is `git pull`, I often use it to sync with the latest changes when editing code ofline.

- The problem I have faced using this command is merge conflicts, so annoying.

- My most common fix when i face this is to use git status to identify conflicts, then manually resolve them and committ again. Works most of the time.
