# Version Control & Collaboration

## Q4: 

I participated in a couple of open source hackathons and git and github became an everyday ritual when it came to collaboration, the comunity was good, and i learned a lot while interacting with version control tools. Here are a few commands i learned and still use to date: `git add` `git commit` `git push` `git rebase` `git pull` `git status` `git log` `git merge` `git branch` `git tag` `git diff` and among many others.

- My common Git command is `git pull`, I often use it to sync with the latest changes when editing code ofline.
- The problem I have faced using this command is merge conflicts, so annoying.
- My most common fix when i face this is to use git status to identify conflicts, then manually resolve them and committ again. Works most of the time.
