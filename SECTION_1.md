# Q1: Logic & Problem Solving (10 marks)

```
def second_largest(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    unique_nums.sort()
    return unique_nums[-2]
```

### Explanation:
I first remove duplicates, then sort the list, and return second last item.

# Q2:

- Too many large images: Compress or use modern formats like WebP.

- Too many requests: Combine files, use lazy loading, and caching.

- Unoptimized scripts: Minify JS/CSS and defer non-critical scripts.
